title: Efficient Inverted Indexes for Approximate Retrieval over Learned Sparse Representations
subtitle: "This article describes a novel retrieval algorithm developed for collections of sparse vectors.
This work, which is published in the proceedings of SIGIR'24, is the culmination of a joint collaboration with
my brilliant colleagues Rossano Venturini (of the University of Pisa), Cosimo Rulli and Franco Maria Nardini
(both of the Italian National Research Council, ISTI-CNR). Our proposed algorithm marks a seismic shift in
retrieval over learnt sparse embeddings of text collections in accuracy and speed. We are all equally proud of
this paper!

Picture this. You have a rather large collection of (short) text documents. Passages from long legal or
financial documents; snippets from novels; or articles from the web, are a few examples.
Typically you are not just hoarding data for no reason. Instead, you have collected this data so that you can
process it. One very routine example is to *find* information that is relevant to you, or can help you answer
a very specific question.

Considering the sheer volume of massive collections, it would be nearly impossible to sift through all this data
manually to find answers to your questions, right? That is why "search" has become such an indispensable tool that
we rely on daily. We have a question (a "query") and we wish to find, from this large collection of
documents, a subset that is relevant to our question or helps answer it!

In Information Retrieval (IR) jargon, the problem of finding the most relevant item(s) to a query is simply
called *retrieval*. To make this problem precise, however, we need to define how queries and items are
represented, and how we define relevance or similarity between items. Because we are interested
in an algorithmic solution to the retrieval problem, these definitions had better be amenable to mathematical
and computational operations.

### Vector representations of text

That brings us to the modern way of representing text (or indeed data of any modality): embeddings.
For brevity, I'll skip over a long history of lexical representations of text and won't even begin to
explain how embedding models are trained---you can read more about
that in [this excellent book](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06467)
{% cite lin2021pretrainedtransformerstextranking %}.
For the purposes of this post, let's just think of "models" as some function that act on text and produce
a representation, and whose inner workings are irrelevant to us.

One prevalent and practical paradigm is to use an embedding model to encode a query or document
independently into a vector space, like in Figure 1.


![](/assets/figures/seismic/embedding.png){: width="100%" }
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 1. A model that embeds text into a dense vector space.
The individual coordinates in this
vector space aren't typically meaningful on their own.
</i></div>


Notice the "dense" keyword in the figure? That's because the output of the embedding model
is a dense vector! In simple terms, a dense vector is a vector whose every entry is almost surely non-zero.
While that is one of the most common types of embeddings you will encounter in the literature
and in many applications, there is another type that offers unique and attractive properties:
sparse embeddings. See Figure 2.


![](/assets/figures/seismic/sparse-embedding.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 2. A model that embeds text into a sparse vector space.
The output space has thousands to tens of thousands or more dimensions.
Each dimension represents a term in some dictionary (e.g., the English vocabulary),
and the weights signal the semantic "importance" or relevance of the terms to the
information contained in the input.
</i></div>


The focus of [our paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626772.3657769)
{% cite bruch2024efficientinvertedindexesapproximate %} is on these **sparse representations.**
There are a number of reasons sparse embeddings are important enough to justify (our) research.
**Interpretability** is one major factor: When every dimension corresponds to a term
in some vocabulary, it is easy to understand what the embedding has extracted and captured from
its input---"dictionary learning," as it is sometimes known, is indeed a way to gain insight
into large language models.
In Figure 2, for example, the word "hop" has a non-zero weight, despite
the fact that it does not appear in the input, though it is synonymous with "jump," which does appear.

### Inner Product as a measure of similarity

So we have defined how we represent text. Onto the second missing piece: How we define similarity.
Considering our representation of text is in some vector space, it won't surprise you to learn
that similarity is measured by some notion of distance in vector spaces. Typical examples are
the Euclidean distance, and, more commonly, angular distance or cosine similarity.

In our work, we consider a more general notion of similarity that includes the other two as special cases:
inner product. If two vectors {% katexmm %} $u, v \in \mathbb{R}^d$ {% endkatexmm %} are
{% katexmm %} $d${% endkatexmm %}-dimensional vectors, then their inner product is
{% katexmm %} $\langle u, v \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^d u_i v_i$ {% endkatexmm %}, where
the subscript {% katexmm %} $i$ {% endkatexmm %} specifies the {% katexmm %} $i${% endkatexmm %}-th
coordinate.

Let's try to get a sense of what this means geometrically. In Figure 3, I plotted a few data points
{% katexmm %} ($u, v, w$, and $p$)  {% endkatexmm %} and a query point
{% katexmm %} ($q$) {% endkatexmm %} in two dimensions.
Which one of these data points has the largest inner product 
with {% katexmm %} $q$? {% endkatexmm %} The answer is {% katexmm %} $p${% endkatexmm %}, but why?
Take the direction of {% katexmm %}$q${% endkatexmm %} (i.e., the line from the origin that passes
through {% katexmm %} $q${% endkatexmm %}), and imagine the plane perpendicular to it
({% katexmm %}$h${% endkatexmm %}). Start moving {% katexmm %} $h$ {% endkatexmm %} out towards
infinity along the direction of {% katexmm %} $q${% endkatexmm %}. The last point that touches
{% katexmm %} $h$ {% endkatexmm %} maximizes inner product with {% katexmm %} $q${% endkatexmm %}!
This geometric interpretation extends naturally to higher dimensions too. Neat, no?!


![](/assets/figures/seismic/mips.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 3. Geometric interpretation of maximum inner product search.
Of the data points in the figure {% katexmm %} ($u, v, w$, and $p$)  {% endkatexmm %},
{% katexmm %} $p$ {% endkatexmm %} has the largest inner product with the query
point {% katexmm %} $q${% endkatexmm %}: It is the last point that touches
{% katexmm %} $h$, {% endkatexmm %} a plane that is orthogonal to the direction of
{% katexmm %} $q${% endkatexmm %}, as it sweeps the space from origin
along the direction of {% katexmm %} $q$. {% endkatexmm %}
Using the same reasoning, it should be clear that {% katexmm %} $u$ {% endkatexmm %}
has the second largest inner product with {% katexmm %} $q$. {% endkatexmm %}
</i></div>

### Approximate Maximum Inner Product Search

While inner product is easy to define and wrap your head around,
efficiently identifying a set of vectors that maximize
the inner product with a query vector (i.e.,
{% katexmm %} $\argmax_u \langle q, u \rangle$ {% endkatexmm %}
) is, in general, hard in higher dimensions. There are many reasons why
that is the case, which I will not get into here. If you are interested,
you can find out why in my
[monograph on the subject](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09350) {% cite Bruch_2024 %}.

That is not to say we don't have efficient ways of *approximately* solving the problem.
That is, if we can tolerate a bit of error, then there are many classes of efficient algorithms
that become relevant {% cite Bruch_2024 %}. What "error" means is that, for a query {% katexmm %} $q$ {% endkatexmm %},
the set of {% katexmm %} $k$ {% endkatexmm %} points returned by an approximate algorithm
may contain points whose inner product with {% katexmm %} $q$ {% endkatexmm %} may be smaller than
the true {% katexmm %} $k$-th {% endkatexmm %} largest inner product. If {% katexmm %} $k=10$ {% endkatexmm %},
then maybe one point in the returned set is there erroneously, incorrectly replacing a true maximizer of
inner product---in which case, the *accuracy* of our approximate algorithm would be
{% katexmm %} $90\%$. {% endkatexmm %}

This relaxation helps us speed up retrieval. In fact, once you get in the right mindset that
error is inevitable and that we can tolerate some degree of inaccuracy, then you can often trade off
accuracy for speed, and vice versa! But how do we design an approximate algorithm? What properties of
data can be leverage to approximately identify the solution to maximum inner product search,
particularly in the context of learnt sparse embeddings? That finally brings us to what motivated our
proposed method. 

### Concentration of mass

I often argue that a vector, any vector, is just a bunch of noise plus a bit of signal.
I don't claim this is original and don't think it's controversial either.
That's essentially the philosophy that powers much of the literature on sketching
high-dimensional vectors {% cite Woodruff_2014 %} into low-dimensional subspaces---I'm
being a bit handwavy, but hopefully you get the point.

We started from that philosophy and examined a number of benchmark retrieval datasets,
including the [MS MARCO](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/) Passage Retrieval collection
embedded as sparse vectors with different flavors of the [Splade](https://github.com/naver/splade) model.
What we observed is a manifestation of that philosophy: Most of the information represented by
a sparse vector is concentrated in a few coordinates, with the rest amounting to noise.
Let me elaborate.

Take a sparse embedding, say {% katexmm %} $u \in \mathbb{R}^d$ {% endkatexmm %},
from this family of models and look at its mass.
Mass here means the {% katexmm %} $L_1$ {% endkatexmm %} norm:
{% katexmm %} $\lVert u \rVert_1 = \sum_{i=1}^d \lvert u_i \rvert$. {% endkatexmm %}
Now, sort the coordinates (the subscript {% katexmm %} $i$'s) {% endkatexmm %} by how
much {% katexmm %} $u_i$'s {% endkatexmm %} contribute to the mass: The coordinate
with the largest absolute value comes first, second largest second, and so on.

From this ordered list, collect the top {% katexmm %} $\kappa$ {% endkatexmm %} coordinates,
and compute the partial sum of {% katexmm %} $\lvert u_i \rvert$'s {% endkatexmm %} corresponding
to those coordinates.
It should be obvious that as {% katexmm %} $\kappa$ {% endkatexmm %} gets larger,
the partial sum converges to the {% katexmm %} $L_1$ {% endkatexmm %} norm of {% katexmm %} $u$. {% endkatexmm %}
What is surprising, however, is that even when {% katexmm %} $\kappa$ {% endkatexmm %} is small
(say, less than half of the total number of non-zero entries in {% katexmm %} $u%${% endkatexmm %}),
we recover most of the {% katexmm %} $L_1$ {% endkatexmm %} mass anyway! This is what
the left subfigure in Figure 4 illustrates.


![](/assets/figures/seismic/concentration-of-l1-norm.png){: width="49%"}
![](/assets/figures/seismic/partial-ip.png){: width="49%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 4. [Left] The {% katexmm %} $L_1$ {% endkatexmm %} mass of a learnt sparse embedding
is mostly recovered from less than half of the largest non-zero coordinates (ordered by absolute value).
[Right] Most of the inner product between a query point and a data point can be recovered from the partial
inner product of the largest coordinates.
</i></div>


That is what we expected to see. In fact, a similar observation based on the {% katexmm %} $L_2$ {% endkatexmm %}
norm was recently developed into a very effective dimensionality reduction algorithm for sparse vectors
{% cite daliri2024samplingmethodsinnerproduct %}. Super!

Let me refer to a subvector made up of the top {% katexmm %} $\alpha$ {% endkatexmm %} fraction
of coordinates of a vector, as its {% katexmm %} *$\alpha$-mass subvector.* {% endkatexmm %}
It's kind of a messy definition, but it makes talking about this business of ordering coordinates
and taking the top fraction of them easier.

Back to our observation. What is perhaps even more interesting is that, if we take the inner product
between the {% katexmm %} $\alpha$-mass {% endkatexmm %} subvector of a data point, with the
{% katexmm %} $\beta$-mass {% endkatexmm %} subvector of a query, we can get arbitrarily close
to the full inner product between the original vectors! That is what the right plot in Figure 4
shows: Partial inner product between the top 15 coordinates of a query with the top 75 coordinates
of a document gives us almost all of the inner product between them.

This observation, which we called the "concentration of importance" (for consistency with IR jargon)
gave us what we needed to design
an approximate retrieval algorithm. Intuitively, we can throw away {% katexmm %} $(1-\alpha)$ {% endkatexmm %}
fraction of data (and query) points and approximate the full inner product with arbitrary accuracy.
So we have what we were looking for: a lever to control accuracy for speed. 
Next section explains how we take advantage of that property to design Seismic---our proposed algorithm.

### Seismic

Seismic is a backronym that stands for
**S**pilled Clust**e**ring of **I**nverted Lists with **S**ummaries for **M**aximum **I**nner
Produ**c**t Search. Don't ask me why, but our inside joke was that "*the microsecond territory is shaking*,"
which led to this name for the algorithm---that name is one of my greatest accomplishments yet, and I'm
famously not very creative with naming things!

If phrases like "spilled clustering" and "inverted lists" sound foreign,
I will explain what they mean in a minute as I describe the
two components of the algorithm: Indexing (data preprocessing) and retrieval (query processing or search).
The rest of this section gives an intuitive construction of the data structures and the main
algorithm that make up Seismic and were introduced more rigorously in our paper.

#### Index structure
Let me preface this section by noting that,
generally speaking, more than 90% of the battle in designing a vector retrieval (or nearest neighbor search)
algorithm is organizing the vectors into an index---although, in a
[recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12207) {% cite bruch2024optimisticqueryroutingclusteringbased %},
we challenge that conventional wisdom. That is because, whether the index is a graph or a list of
clusters with centroids, the retrieval algorithm is usually simple and greedy. So the right place to
leverage the "concentration of importance" property is during indexing.

Seismic starts by building a good ol' inverted index: A map that is keyed by coordinate index
(the subscript {% katexmm %} $i$ in $u_i${% endkatexmm %}), and where
{% katexmm %} $i$ {% endkatexmm %} points to a list of vector ids whose
{% katexmm %} $i$-th {% endkatexmm %} coordinate is non-zero. Each of those lists is called an
*inverted list*, so that an inverted index is a mapping from coordinates to inverted lists.
Historically, this data structure has been at the heart of sparse vector retrieval algorithms.
This is what Figure 5 visualizes for a single coordinate.


![](/assets/figures/seismic/inverted-list.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 5. A coordinate pointing to an inverted list (i.e., id of vectors (colored boxes) whose
{% katexmm %} $i$-th {% endkatexmm %} coordinate is non-zero. Pairs like this
make up an inverted index.
</i></div>


In the first step of the algorithm, we truncate each inverted list and retain only the ids of
{% katexmm %} $\lambda$ {% endkatexmm %} vectors with the largest {% katexmm %} $i$-th {% endkatexmm %}
coordinate. That results in the structure in Figure 6.


![](/assets/figures/seismic/inverted-list-truncated.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 6. Truncated inverted list. We retain {% katexmm %} $\lambda$ {% endkatexmm %}
vector with the largest {% katexmm %} $i$-th {% endkatexmm %} coordinate.
</i></div>


How does this relate to the "concentration of importance" property? To understand that connection,
it helps to visualize the vector collection as a matrix, as shown in Figure 7.
In the figure, I'm plotting a matrix whose columns are data points and rows correspond to dimensions.
White space represents zeros and the intensity of the shade of each block is supposed to convey the
magnitude of each non-zero coordinate.

![](/assets/figures/seismic/sparsification.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 7. Concentration of importance manifests as row-wise sparsification of the data matrix.
We discard an entry from a row if {% katexmm %} $\lambda$ {% endkatexmm %} other vectors have a larger
absolute value.
</i></div>


By truncating each inverted list (i.e., a row in the matrix),
we discard entries from vectors *conditioned on other vectors*:
{% katexmm %} $u_i$ {% endkatexmm %} can only be discarded if there are {% katexmm %} $\lambda$ {% endkatexmm %}
other vectors with a larger {% katexmm %} $i$-th {% endkatexmm %} coordinate.
In this way, one vector may turn into its {% katexmm %} $0.9$-mass subvector {% endkatexmm %},
another to {% katexmm %} $.2$-mass subvector {% endkatexmm %}, and another may remain completely intact.
In other words, the importance of {% katexmm %} $u_i$ {% endkatexmm %} is determined not only
relative to {% katexmm %} $\lVert u \rVert_1$ {% endkatexmm %}, but also relative to other
vectors present in the collection.

Now that our inverted list for coordinate {% katexmm %} $i$ {% endkatexmm %} is truncated,
we take the vectors corresponding to the {% katexmm %} $\lambda$ {% endkatexmm %} ids in the list,
and apply geometric clustering (e.g., some variant of KMeans) to them. This results in
{% katexmm %} $\beta$ {% endkatexmm %} groups of vector ids,
whose vectors form partitions according to the clustering algorithm! This is visualized in Figure 8.

![](/assets/figures/seismic/blocked-inverted-index.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 8. Clustered inverted list. We apply geometric clustering to the vectors corresponding to
the {% katexmm %} $\lambda$ {% endkatexmm %} ids in the list (after truncation), to form
{% katexmm %} $\beta$ {% endkatexmm %} partitions.
</i></div>


If this looks familiar to you, that's probably because you know how clustering-based
nearest neighbor search works! However, note that we apply clustering to each inverted list
independently of other inverted lists. And because a vector id can appear in multiple
inverted lists, it can therefore end up in multiple (overlapping) clusters.
That is why we used the term "spilled clustering" (or spillage) to highlight this phenomenon.

If you know about clustering-based indexes, you also know that each cluster is represented by a
point, such as its centroid. Our index is no different. We equip each cluster (within an inverted list)
with a representative point, called a "sketch" or "summary." There are many ways to sketch a cluster
such as the (coordinate-wise) mean of vectors,
but in our work we choose to work with the following sketches:
We first obtain the coordinate-wise maximum of all vectors present in a cluster, then take
its {% katexmm %} $\alpha$-mass {% endkatexmm %} subvector as the final sketch!
Schematically, this is what is presented in Figure 9.


![](/assets/figures/seismic/sketched-blocks.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 9. Sketched blocks of the {% katexmm %} $i$-th {% endkatexmm %} inverted list.
For each cluster, we take the coordinate-wise maximum of its vectors to form a representative vector.
We then take its {% katexmm %} $\alpha$-mass {% endkatexmm %} subvector as the final sketch.
This process is repeated independently for all clusters in all inverted lists.
</i></div>


Why maximum as opposed to mean? When {% katexmm %} $\alpha$ {% endkatexmm %} is large enough,
coordinate-wise maximum gives a "bounding box" around the points within a cluster.
In effect, inner product of an arbitrary query {% katexmm %} $q$ {% endkatexmm %}
with any point in that cluster is necessarily smaller than the
{% katexmm %} $\langle q, s \rangle$ {% endkatexmm %} if {% katexmm %} $s$ {% endkatexmm %}
is the sketch. We will use this property during retrieval to dynamically skip clusters
that have a low likelihood of containing the solution, where we assess that likelihood
based on the inner product between the query and the cluster's sketch.


That wraps up the index construction algorithm (i.e., Algorithm 1 in the paper).
Note that, we introduce three tunable hyper-parameters:   
* {% katexmm %} $\lambda$ {% endkatexmm %}: Truncation parameter.
  A smaller {% katexmm %} $\lambda$ {% endkatexmm %} leads to a sparser inverted index
  which presumably leads to accuracy degradation, whereas a larger value preserves more
  of the dataset, making search slower but more accurate.
* {% katexmm %} $\beta$ {% endkatexmm %}: Number of clusters in each inverted list.
  As {% katexmm %} $\beta \rightarrow \lambda$ {% endkatexmm %}, we form smaller clusters
  whose sketch would more accurately represent them, but because
  there are more clusters to process, search slows down.
* {% katexmm %} $\alpha$ {% endkatexmm %}: Determines the capacity of the
  {% katexmm %} $\alpha$-mass {% endkatexmm %} subvectors when forming cluster sketches.
  A larger {% katexmm %} $\alpha$ {% endkatexmm %} leads to a more complete sketch, with the property
  that the maximum inner product between a query and points in a cluster is less than the
  inner product between the query and the sketch. At the same time, larger values of
  {% katexmm %} $\alpha$ {% endkatexmm %} result in increased storage cost due to larger sketches.

These three parameters give us a way to control accuracy for speed. But to understand why exactly,
we must turn to the retrieval algorithm itself. That's the topic of the next section.

#### Retrieval procedure
Let's say we have formed the index structure described in the preceding section, and are now ready
to serve queries and return the {% katexmm %} top-$k$ {% endkatexmm %} set of vectors for every query.
What now? The query processing procedure in Seismic is actually quite easy to explain.
Let's focus on a single query point for the sake of this discussion---queries are processed independently.

First, let's initialize a heap that will contain pairs consisting of the id of a vector and its inner product
with the query. The heap has a maximum capacity of {% katexmm %} $k$ {% endkatexmm %} elements,
and has the invariant that, at any given time, the vectors present in the heap have the largest inner product
with the query *from among the vectors we have examined up to that time*. At the end of the execution of
the retrieval procedure, then, the {% katexmm %} top-$k$ {% endkatexmm %} set is contained in the heap.

The question now becomes: How do we populate the heap?
To that end, we first order the non-zero coordinates of the query vector and keep `cut` number of the largest coordinates
by absolute value---the result is a (`cut`{% katexmm %}$/|nnz(q)|${% endkatexmm %})-mass subvector
where {% katexmm %} $|nnz(\cdot)|$ {% endkatexmm %} denotes the number of non-zero coordinates.

Take the largest coordinate (say, {% katexmm %}$i${% endkatexmm %}) and look up its
inverted list, as shown in Figure 10. Now, compute the inner product between the query and the sketch of the first cluster
in the inverted list. If this inner product is smaller than the minimum inner product in the heap (scaled
by a hyper-parameter called `heap_factor`), then we skip this cluster and move to the next.
Otherwise, we grab the raw vectors whose ids are present in that cluster from storage,
compute the true inner product between them and the full query vector, and insert each into the heap.
Note that, when the heap grows past {% katexmm %} $k$ {% endkatexmm %} records, we simply drop the
smallest values until there are at most {% katexmm %} $k$ {% endkatexmm %} vectors in it.


![](/assets/figures/seismic/retrieval-step-1.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 10. The first step in retrieval. We look up the inverted list corresponding to the largest
coordinate in the query vector. We then compute the inner product between the query and the sketch
of the first cluster in that inverted list. Since that score is greater than the minimum value present
in the heap, we compute the true inner product between the query and vectors in that cluster,
and insert those vectors (paired with their id) into the heap.
</i></div>


We repeat the procedure above for all clusters in the {% katexmm %}$i$-th{% endkatexmm %} list.
When we processed the last cluster, the heap might look like what is depicted in Figure 11.


![](/assets/figures/seismic/retrieval-step-2.png){: width="100%"}
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>
Figure 11. Final state of the heap after processing the {% katexmm %}$i$-th{% endkatexmm %}
inverted list. During the processing, we skip over a large number of blocks because their
sketches tell us that the likelihood that a point from those clusters could end up in the
{% katexmm %}top-$k${% endkatexmm %} set is low.
</i></div>


Finally, we repeat this entire procedure for every one of those `cut` query coordinates.
That's all there is to Seismic's retrieval algorithm (i.e., Algorithm 2 in the paper)!
Its relative efficiency, as shown by
a variety of experiments in the paper, is the result of the fact that we dynamically skip
over a large number of clusters when visiting each inverted list. That is so thanks to
the sketches: We use the inner product between a query and a sketch to gauge how likely it is
that a point in a cluster can out-score the vectors that are already present in the heap.


### Summary of experiments
We put Seismic through a great deal of experiments and compared its performance against
state-of-the-art sparse retrieval methods, from traditional inverted index-based solutions
to graph-based approximate MIPS and more. We paid particular attention to accuracy, speed,
index size, and index construction time, and studied their trade-offs.

I refer you to the paper for a complete set of results and a detailed discussion, but I'd like
to highlight one set of experiments in Figure 12, summarizing Seismic's latency at various
accuracy levels.

I am a research scientist at [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io) where I lead the investigation
of efficient and effective algorithms and data structures for
safe (i.e., w/ guarantees), constrained (i.e., w/ filtering)
retrieval over dynamic, heterogeneous vectors, as well as learning to rank in vector spaces.
My research interests also include the theory of stochastic ranking policies
and a multifaceted study of efficiency, from time and space complexity to
resource and energy consumption.

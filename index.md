I am a research scientist at [Pinecone](https://pinecone.io) where I lead the investigation
of efficient and effective algorithms and probabilistic data structures for constrained Maximum Inner Product Search over dynamic, heterogeneous vectors, as well as learning to rank in vector spaces.
My research interests also include the theory of stochastic ranking policies
and a multifaceted study of efficiency, from time and space complexity to
resource and energy consumption.

it occurred to me that there was no single resource that covered
the foundations of vector retrieval or a treatise that dealt with the fascinating
literature on nearest neighbor search and all the beautiful theory behind it.</p>

<p>So I decided to write one, particularly geared towards graduate students,
with an emphasis on the theoretical foundations of the field.
I hope “Foundations of Vector Retrieval” proves a helpful reference,
one that makes it a bit easier for you
to pick up this topic, navigate the literature, continue this research, and make new discoveries!</p>

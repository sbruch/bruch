**Bio**: I'm a Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for Experiential AI
at the Northeastern University in Boston, MA.
I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland
at College Park, under the supervision of Jimmy Lin---who is now at the University
of Waterloo. My research centers around probabilistic data structures and approximate algorithms
for retrieval, and efficient and effective algorithms for learning-to-rank.
I'm the author of "Foundations of Vector Retrieval" and am presently serving as an
Associate Editor for the ACM TOIS journal.

**Philosophy**: "Man muss noch Chaos in sich haben,
um einen tanzenden Stern gebären zu können."
(Translation: You must have chaos within you to give
birth to a dancing star.) --Friedrich Nietzsche

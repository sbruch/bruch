**Bio**: I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland
at College Park, under the supervision of Jimmy Lin---who is now at the University
of Waterloo. My research has centered around probabilistic data structures and approximate algorithms
for retrieval, and efficient and effective algorithms for learning-to-rank.
I'm the author of "Foundations of Vector Retrieval" and am presently serving as an
Associate Editor for the ACM TOIS journal.


**Academic Service**:

+ [2023-10 - 2026-10] I am serving as an Associate Editor on the ACM Transactions
on Information Systems (TOIS) [Editorial Board](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tois/editorial-board).

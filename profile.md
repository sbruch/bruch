**Bio**: I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2013.
My research since has centered around probabilistic data structures and approximate algorithms for retrieval,
efficient and effective algorithms for learning-to-rank, and stochastic ranking functions.
I'm the author of "Foundations of Vector Retrieval" and the co-author of
"Efficient and Effective Tree-based and Neural Learning to Rank."

My works have appeared in leading Information Systems journals
including ACM TOIS, IEEE TKDE, and FnT in IR. I've also contributed to the proceedings
of and served on the program committees of premier IR and data mining conferences including
SIGIR, WSDM, SIGKDD, and the Web Conference. I'm presently serving as an
Associate Editor for the ACM TOIS journal.

After nearly a decade in industry, I returned to academia in 2024 and am currently a
Senior Research Scientist at the Northeastern University in Boston, MA, United States.
